  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Innovation of Solar Electric Power as a Future Trend</h1>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Jackey Shen</h3>
  <p>The innovation of solar electric power is necessary because conventional renewable technologies have low efficiency and high costs. Nowadays, only radical innovation can successful improve solar power’s comparative advantage in the energy market and tackle climate change.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">New Technologies: Solar Roofs & Solar Windows</h2>
  <p>3 IN 1 ROOF and Forward solar roofing use two different strategies to avoid traditional solar panels’ decrease in solar functionality caused by increasing surface temperature. 3 IN 1 Roof uses heat resistant closed-cell foam, and Forward solar roofing optimizes the space between the panel and the deck of the roof. Both strategies can be used to keep the panel cool during hot summer days to maintain high efficiency compared with standard solar panels.</p>
  <p>SolarWindowTM and Brite Solar are both solar glass companies, but they use two different technologies. SolarWindowTM uses the liquid coating with cells primarily made from hydrogen and carbon (Calderone, 2019). Brite Solar uses ink-jet printing, which has TiO2 (Titanium Dioxide) and WO3 (Tungsten Trioxide) (Brite Hellas, 2017). It seems like SolarWindowTM will have a lower price because of cheap organic materials. However, SolarWindowTM has not thought about using thermal insulation materials to reduce energy consumption, which is Brite Solar’s advantage.</p>
  <p>Brite Solar’s first target is to apply solar glass to greenhouses. If the solar glass can save energy costs for the greenhouses market, more people will be willing to work for the greenhouse market, which also means more vegetables to feed the increasing population and more opportunities for farmers. If the food market prefers vegetables to meat, vegetables’ comparative advantage will be increased. Meanwhile, less meat production and consumption represent less carbon footprint during
the production and transportation processes. Although this project focuses on electricity, the combination of energy-saving for transportation and agriculture will be the next step for the goal of tackling climate change.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Payback Time of Tesla Solarglass Roof</h3>

  <p>These comparisons prove that if a customer has a new house without a roof. Tesla Solarglass Roof will be a great electricity source because of its faster payback time compared with that of conventional solar panels. However, if a customer has an old house with a roof, Tesla Solarglass Roof will not be a good choice.</p>
  <p>The differences exist because for a new house without a roof, if the customer chooses conventional solar panels, he or she needs to pay for both a new roof and the solar panels. However, Tesla Solarglass Roof helps the customer save money from avoiding buying a new roof. Also, for an old house with a roof, Tesla Solarglass Roof has slower payback time because customers need to pay for removing the old house first, then install Tesla Solarglass Roof.</p>

  <p>Overall, Solar Window Technologies, Inc. will have the ability to pay current debts in one year. However, it has too many long-term debts. Also, it has negative retained earnings and negative net income. As a startup that is on the process of raising funds and designing products, probably in one or two years, when it starts selling SolarWindowTM, it will quickly be on the good track according to its one-year payback financial model.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Will the future development of solar PV systems keep the global temperature increase below 1.5°C and 2°C?</p>
  <p>H0: Future solar energy development will not keep the temperature growth below 1.5°C and 2°C by 2100.</p>
  <p>HA: Future solar energy development will keep the temperature growth below 1.5°C and 2°C by 2100.</p>
